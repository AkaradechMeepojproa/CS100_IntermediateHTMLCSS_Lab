# CS100 Basic Web Development 1 - Lab Sheet 1

## Creating a Basic Web Page Layout Using CSS

### Objective
This lab teaches students how to create a simple web page layout using HTML and CSS. Students will apply floats and basic styling to divide a web page into sections based on a given design.

### Files Needed
- `index.html` (provided)
- `layout.css` (to be created)

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understanding the HTML Structure
- Open the provided `index.html` file in a code editor.
- Review the HTML structure:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>Web Layout Exercise</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>Header</header>
    <nav>Nav</nav>
    <article>Article <span>text1</span> <span>text2</span></article>
    <div>Ads</div>
    <footer>Footer</footer>
</body>
</html>
```

This file contains the structure we will style using CSS.

---

### Step 2: Setting Up the CSS File
- In your code editor, create a new file and name it `layout.css`.
- In the `<head>` section of `index.html`, link the CSS file:
```css
```

- Write a CSS rule in `layout.css` to perform the following:
   - Set all the margins and padding for all HTML elements to be zero to ensure consistent rendering across different browsers.
   - Use the CSS selector that can apply the style to all elements.
   - Set the `box-sizing` property so that padding and border are included in the width and height.
```css
```
